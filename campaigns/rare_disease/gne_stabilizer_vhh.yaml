# UNCONVENTIONAL: Enzyme stabilization, NOT blockade
# Must NOT occlude NAG binding pocket (substrate accessibility)
# Must accommodate known GNE mutations: L127P, D207N, M712V
# Enzyme must remain catalytically active when bound
# Intracellular target — delivery is a major challenge
# Extended H3 to span domain interface
